        "2. **Variance:**\n",
        "   - Variance calculates the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It quantifies how data points deviate from the mean. A high variance implies greater dispersion.\n",

        "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
        "   - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the average amount by which data points deviate from the mean. A smaller standard deviation means data points are closer to the mean.\n",

        "- **Correlation** is preferred for assessing the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It's widely used for comparing relationships across different datasets because of its standardized range and unitless nature.

        "Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation). Their influence can skew the results and affect the overall interpretation of the data. Here's how outliers affect these measures and an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mean:**\n",
        "   - Outliers can pull the mean in their direction. If there are high-value outliers, the mean tends to be higher than expected, and vice versa for low-value outliers.\n",
        "   - Example: In a dataset of monthly incomes, a billionaire's income as an outlier will significantly increase the mean, making it unrepresentative of the typical income.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Median:**\n",
        "   - The median is less sensitive to outliers. It is less affected by extreme values because it represents the middle value. Outliers have minimal impact on the median.\n",
        "   - Example: In the same income dataset, the median remains largely unaffected by the billionaire's income.\n",
        "\n",

It's essential to identify and understand the impact of outliers, especially when they are influential in a dataset, as they can significantly skew results and misrepresent the underlying characteristics of the data. Analyzing data with and without outliers can provide a more accurate understanding of the overall distribution and tendencies."
