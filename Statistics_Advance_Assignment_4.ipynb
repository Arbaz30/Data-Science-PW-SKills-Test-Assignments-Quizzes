        "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data, but they are typically applied in different situations due to differences in the assumptions about the population and the available information. Here's the key difference and examples of scenarios where each test is used:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Population Variance Known vs. Unknown:**\n",
        "   - **Z-Test**: This test is used when you know the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) and want to test a hypothesis about a population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) based on a sample.\n",
        "   - **T-Test**: This test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown, and you estimate it from the sample data using the sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)). It's particularly useful for small sample sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Sample Size:**\n",
        "   - **Z-Test**: Z-tests are appropriate when the sample size is large (typically \\(n \\geq 30\\)) due to the central limit theorem, which allows the normal distribution to be a good approximation of the sample distribution.\n",
        "   - **T-Test**: T-tests are suitable for small sample sizes, where the central limit theorem may not apply, and the t-distribution provides a better approximation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Z-Test Example:**\n",
        "Suppose you work for a car manufacturer and you want to test whether a new fuel injection system results in a significant improvement in gas mileage. You have historical data that tells you the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of gas mileage. You collect a large sample of cars (e.g., \\(n \\geq 30\\)) using the new system and calculate the sample mean. You can use a z-test to determine whether the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "**T-Test Example:**\n",
        "Imagine you're a food scientist studying the effect of a new cooking method on the tenderness of a particular meat product. You don't have prior information about the population standard deviation for tenderness, so you collect a small sample of meat products (e.g., \\(n < 30\\)) and measure tenderness. In this case, you should use a t-test to assess whether the sample mean tenderness is significantly different from what you'd expect based on the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on whether you know the population standard deviation, the sample size, and whether the central limit theorem can be applied. Use a z-test when you know the population standard deviation, have a large sample, and can rely on the normal distribution. Use a t-test when the population standard deviation is unknown, the sample size is small, or when dealing with data that doesn't follow a normal distribution."

There are two types of one-tailed tests: left-tailed and right-tailed.\n",
