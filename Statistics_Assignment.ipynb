        "1. Nominal Level: This is the lowest level of measurement, where data is categorized into distinct, non-ordered categories. The categories are mutually exclusive and don't have any inherent ranking. Examples include:\n",
        "   - Types of cars (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck)\n",
        "   - Gender (e.g., male, female, non-binary)\n",

        "   - Educational degrees (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree)\n",
        "   - Customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., very dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Interval Level: Interval data have consistent intervals between values, but there is no true zero point. This means that you can perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction, but you can't meaningfully calculate ratios. Examples include:\n",

        "These measures help describe datasets in various ways. The measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) provide a sense of the \"typical\" value or most common values in the dataset.
